# ✨ ReploApp - Flávia's Speedy Dev Showcase 🚀

Welcome to **ReploApp**! This project is a **live demonstration** of why I'm the perfect fit for the Full-Stack Engineer role at Replo. It not only shows my technical expertise but also reflects the **speed and agility** required to thrive in a fast-paced startup environment. ⚡

## 🌟 Why This Project?

I believe actions speak louder than words, so instead of telling you how I work, I decided to **show** you. Here's how this project proves I’m the right person for the job:

- **🔥 Always Shipping**: Just like at Replo, I don't wait for perfect conditions. I ship quickly and iterate fast. This project was conceptualized, built, and deployed in no time.
- **⚙️ Full-Stack Mastery**: Leveraging **TypeScript, React, Node.js** is my jam. I decided to use HTML and CSS for a quick show of how quickly I can deliver, but I am excited to show you what I can do with React. 
- **🤖 AI-Powered Development**: I integrated GPT-like tools to accelerate development. Smart tools mean faster shipping without compromising quality.
