            <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi Replo Team! Letâ€™s Build Something Awesome</h2>
            <p>I'm FlÃ¡via, a full-stack engineer with **big startup energy** and a love for creating user-centric, real-world solutions. 
            What gets me excited? <strong>TypeScript, React, Node.js</strong>, and seeing users light up when a feature drops.
            My experience aligns with everything Replo is looking for. No, seriouslyâ€”it's like you're describing my day-to-day at Bendcircular, another early-stage startup where we shipped features with lightning speed!</p>
            <p>Replo says "always shipping" â€” that's my personal mantra. Features, improvements, or bug fixes? Let's ship it ðŸš€!</p>

            <h2>ðŸ’¡ Why Replo & FlÃ¡via are a Startup Dream Team</h2>
            <p>Let's break it down:</p>
            <ul class="match-list">
                <li><strong>You want TypeScript/React/Node pros?</strong> â€” Iâ€™ve built entire features end-to-end with this exact stack. From AI tools to full on websites it's what I do!</li>
                <li><strong>Always shipping?</strong> â€” At Bendcircular, shipping was my middle name. We moved fast and iterated even faster.</li>
                <li><strong>AI acceleration?</strong> â€” I already leverage GPT to speed up dev time. Itâ€™s like having a superpower to focus on what really mattersâ€”innovation and user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Startup experience?</strong> â€” Been there, done that. Early-stage chaos is where I shine. Iâ€™m comfortable without constant product/design support, and I thrive in ambiguity.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer-first mindset?</strong> â€” You want products that solve real pain points? So do I! I build with users in mind and get a kick out of delighting them with fast, intuitive solutions.</li>
